                                              a bank you can trust
```

A simple bank management system that our team put out for school.

It can do most basic bank-related tasks, and then some. \
Also features a terminal based user interface, completely written the ground up from scratch.

Requires ~~only~~ [`colorama`](https://pypi.org/project/colorama/), because we really like colours.

As of now, bank9000™ only runs on windows machines, because of its dependency on the `msvcrt` library's `getch` function to read keypresses. Linux/Mac support will arrive shortly.
