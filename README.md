A simple bank management system that our team put out for school.

It can do most basic bank-related tasks, and then some. \
Also features a terminal based user interface, completely written from scratch.

Requires [`requests`](https://pypi.org/project/requests/) for fancy internet things, and [`colorama`](https://pypi.org/project/colorama/), because we really like colours. \
To get bank9000â„¢ running on linux, you would also need to get [`getch`](https://pypi.org/project/getch/).
