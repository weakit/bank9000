A simple bank management system that our team put out for school.

It can do most basic bank-related tasks, and then some. \
Also features a terminal based user interface, completely written from scratch.

Requires [`requests`](https://pypi.org/project/requests/) for fancy internet things, and [`colorama`](https://pypi.org/project/colorama/), because we really like colours. \
To get bank9000™ running on linux, you would also need to get [`getch`](https://pypi.org/project/getch/).

## Running bank9000™

Make sure to first install the required dependencies by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

Run `python ./bank.py` in a terminal (or command prompt if on windows). Other envirnoments are not supported, and mostly will not work.

Python 3 only.
